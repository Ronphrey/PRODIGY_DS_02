# Titanic Dataset EDA

This project contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, focusing on the factors that influenced passenger survival. The dataset, which is well-known in machine learning and data science, provides a rich source of information about the demographics and characteristics of passengers aboard the Titanic.

## Contents

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and drop irrelevant columns.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualize survival rate by passenger class, gender, age, fare, and embarkation point.
- **Conclusions and Recommendations**: Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
